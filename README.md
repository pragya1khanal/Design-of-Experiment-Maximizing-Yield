Design-of-Experiment-Maximizing-Yield in (%) of the chemical process with the use of 8 additives or factors

The main objective of this project was to maximize the yield in (%) of the chemical process with the use of 8 additives or factors. The yield could be anywhere between 0% to 100% but the preference is for higher values. We had a budget of 75 experimental runs, and we had to achieve the maximum within those runs. All the eight factors were continuous and limited to the interval [0,10]. I used fractional factorial, definitive screening and central composite design in this journey of obtaining the maximum response. Comparing these three methods, I chose Central Composite Design as my final design.
The final model I used to determine the best settings to use is given below:

In this model, A, B and interaction between A and B are significant.

From the above contour plot, we can observe that the yield is 56 when A is set at 5 and D is set at 0.7 approximately.
